This is my first ios application build by the cool fusetools 
https://www.fusetools.com


This application using the Firebase API of Hacker News https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com
to fetch the news from https://news.ycombinator.com, you can view the original web page of the news or the comments.

There are still two thing need to do:
1. Add the standard share extentions of iOS.
2. Fetching all the comments. Currently only fetch the first level of comments.
